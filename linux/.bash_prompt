# rollen bash.
# 
# Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a
# number of backslash-escaped special characters that are
# decoded as follows:
#
#  \a         an ASCII bell character (07)
#  \d         the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
#  \D{format} the format is passed to strftime(3) and the result
#             is inserted into the prompt string an empty format
#             results in a locale-specific time representation.
#             The braces are required
#  \e         an ASCII escape character (033)
#  \h         the hostname up to the first `.'
#  \H         the hostname
#  \j         the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
#  \l         the basename of the shell's terminal device name
#  \n         newline
#  \r         carriage return
#  \s         the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following
#             the final slash)
#  \t         the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
#  \T         the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
#  \@         the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
#  \A         the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
#  \u         the username of the current user
#  \v         the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
#  \V         the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
#  \w         the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
#  \W         the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME
#             abbreviated with a tilde
#  \!         the history number of this command
#  \#         the command number of this command
#  \$         if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
#  \nnn       the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
#  \\         a backslash
#  \[         begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used
#             to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
#  \]         end a sequence of non-printing characters
#         
#  The command number and the history number are usually different:
#  the history number of a command is its position in the history
#  list, which may include commands restored from the history file
#  (see HISTORY below), while the command number is the position in
#  the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session.
#  After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter
#  expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote
#  removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell option (see
#  the description of the shopt command under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
#  below).
