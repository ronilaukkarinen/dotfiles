# Rolle's dotfiles

Using bash daily on Mac and Linux. These are my dotfiles for backup purposes. Inspired by others. Includes modified dracula theme for Hyper.

My CentOS server [Peikko](http://peikko.us) uses a simple prompt with processor temperature, [screenshot here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronilaukkarinen/dotfiles/master/server.png).

## Usage

Git clone and use as you wish or symlink to your locations and get updates with `git pull`.
